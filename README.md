# cs-cloud-server
This is a free stable cs cloud server that is based in the US, Virginia.


To change location, grab an IP adress and place it in line 17 at the end.
The following two lines of code follow up to this point.

IPAddress ipAddress = IPAddress.Any;
            server = new TcpListener(ipAddress, PORT);

!NOTICE!

Before using, make sure you have a stable connection to the server using a vpn. 
Please report any problems within the code, I am not too experienced with cs.

Thank you for reading and have fun adding this to your website/webpage app.
